## 1. Purpose
The Real-Life Capability Index (RLCI) measures the real practical abilities of people in any country.  
It reflects **what people can actually do**: build, repair, learn, create, solve everyday problems, and access materials, tools, and technologies.

RLCI complements or replaces traditional metrics like GDP, HDI, or PPP which do not capture real-life skills, tool availability, cultural access, or practical technological capacity.

---

## 2. Philosophy Behind RLCI
Most country-level indicators reflect government-level performance, not human-level capability.  
RLCI measures:
- availability of tools and materials  
- diversity of hobbies and advanced skills  
- affordability of technology  
- cultural and educational access  
- real-world problem‑solving ability  

It is designed to capture the **real lived quality of life**.

## 3. RLCI Structure — Five Sub-Indexes (0–10 each)

### 3.1 Tool Availability Index (TAI)
Measures:
- diversity of tools (hand tools, power tools)  
- availability in shops and online  
- quality and safety level  

### 3.2 DIY & Skills Activity Index (DSAI)
Measures:
- how many real tasks people perform  
- variety of repairs/builds/modifications  
- demonstrated skills (woodwork, metalwork, electronics, repairs)  

### 3.3 Hobby & Advanced Capability Index (HACI)
Includes:
- 3D printing, robotics, crafts  
- access to tutorials and courses  
- educational ecosystem for advanced hobbies  

### 3.4 Material & Component Diversity Index (MCDI)
Evaluates:
- availability of wood, metal, plastics  
- access to electronics components  
- access to advanced materials (resins, composites, alloys)  

### 3.5 Consumer Affordability & Accessibility Index (CAAI)
Measures:
- affordability relative to salary  
- availability of delivery  
- general access to tools and materials for average citizens

## 4. Scoring Formula
All sub-indexes are scored **0 (very poor) to 10 (excellent)**.

**Final formula:**

RLCI = 0.25 × TAI  
      + 0.25 × DSAI  
      + 0.20 × HACI  
      + 0.15 × MCDI  
      + 0.15 × CAAI

## 5. Data Sources

### Primary source:
- **YouTube** — analysis of real-life builds, repairs, hobby practices, and tool usage.

### Secondary sources:
- Instagram  
- TikTok  
- Local marketplaces  
- DIY forums, blogs  

---

## 6. Evaluation Criteria (Summary)
Each sub-index uses:
- diversity and accessibility of tools  
- DIY culture  
- complexity of builds and repairs  
- availability of advanced materials  
- income-to-cost practicality  

---

## 7. Applications
RLCI can be used by:
- researchers  
- sociologists  
- economists  
- governments  
- tech and market analysts  

It enables true comparison of real-life capability between countries and regions.
